# Cat vs Dog / Classification of various dog breeds
##  An Image Classifier Project
This is a summary of my project for the Winter Internship Program (WIP 3.0) under the CSI chapter of LNMIIT, Jaipur.

### This project has 2 phases. Each of them involves using an image classifier to acheive desired results using image data.
### Phase 1
# Aims to classify an input image as either a dog or a cat image.
### Phase 2
# Aims to classify images of dogs according to their various breeds.

### The image input will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm (Convolutional Neural Networks) is used to classify the image. Various other approcahes/algorithms will also be tested along and their accuracies compared.

## Tools used 
1. python3 
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. tensorflow 
5. matplotlib

## Procedure
A breakdown of the approach I shall be using.
### 1. Finding the right dataset. 
Details of the dataset will be updated.
### 2. Choosing the right models to run on. 
I shall mainly be using Convolutional neural networks to build my model, along with other better approaches I might come across.
### 3. Training the model.
I shall use either my personal computer or cloud services, whichever seems more feasible for training the model.
### 4.Testing out.
### 5. Publishing results.
